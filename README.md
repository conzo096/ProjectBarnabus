### Summary
This is a side project that I am working on to gain a better understanding of how game engines and graphic techniques work. 

The game engine currently uses the following external libraries:
* GLM
* GLFW
* GLEW
* Asset Importer

Currently the game engine only utalises OpenGL, there are plans to introduce Vulkan and DirectX12 however this is very low priority the now. 

Testing of the game engine uses google test. This was so I can get a better understanding of how google test works. 

The current plan for the project is as follows:

1. Add new models for terrain and character (also more in-depth testing of the animation system)
2. User Interface
3. User Input
4. Menus
5. Save and load
